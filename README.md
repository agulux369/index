quick game I made with chat gpt inspired by social deduction games. Each player receives a hidden role displayed on a card. By clicking the card, it flips with a smooth animation and sound effect, revealing the playerâ€™s role. The game includes subtle audio feedback for different actions (flip, select, deselect), making it more immersive and fun to play with friends around a table.

How to Play

The game is played in turns.

Each player flips their card to secretly see their assigned word.

Most players share the same word, but one player is the impostor who receives a different word.

On their turn, each player must say a word related to their assigned word.

The key is to give a hint that is connected enough so your teammates recognize you, but not too obvious, or the impostor might discover the secret word.

After everyone has spoken, players discuss and try to identify the impostor.

This game combines quick thinking, creativity, and bluffing, making it fun and challenging for groups of friends.
